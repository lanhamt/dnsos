# dnSOS

## about
Remember the last time a DNS server went down that resolves a website you needed
to access? Now instead of staring at the error message on your browser you can
do something about it with dnSOS. dnSOS is a simple tool that takes your
browsing history and resolves your visited urls to their IP addresses so you
can get to your favorite sites even when their domain resolver is down.
